This Postman collection and environment are intended as an example for the following tasks in a controlled ACI lab environment. Testing may vary depending on your environment and changes:
- Create an tenant.
- Create one application profile.
- Create two endpoint groups (EPGs) in the existing Application Profile (1 Physical and 1 VMM domain).
- Create two Bridge Domains (BDs) for the existing EPGs.
- Create an ICMP test contract with a subject and filter.
- Create an OSPF L3Out for a dedicated physical point-to-point layer-3 port (ex. eth1/10).
- Create fabric access policies for L3-External Routed Domain, AAEP, Leaf Interface Policy Group, Leaf Interface Profile and interface selector block.
- Modify Leaf switch node profiles to add the new fabric access policies and interfaces.

Assumptions:
- You have completed VMM integration to deploy new configuration into an existing/ established VMM domain.
- You have a Baremetal environment to deploy static path bindings for a physical domain and the static path bindings are completed on the EPG.
- Basic and fundamental ACI fabric tasks have already been completed. (ex. Mgmt Tenant OOB, CDP, LLDP, Interface Speed policies)
- You have an external router for OSPF P2P neighborships to establish the L3Out.


Example files are located in the "Postman-Refined-Files" folder.
